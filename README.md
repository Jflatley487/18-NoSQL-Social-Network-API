# NoSQL Social Network API

This repository contains the code for a NoSQL-based API for a social network web application. The API allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. It is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the NoSQL database, and the Mongoose ODM for data modeling. The API utilizes various HTTP methods to handle CRUD operations for users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.

# Getting Started

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. Refer to the MongoDB installation guide for instructions on how to set it up locally.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm.

4. Configure the MongoDB connection by modifying the .env file and providing the appropriate values for your MongoDB server.

5. Start the server using the npm start

The server should now be running locally on http://localhost:3001. You can use API testing tools like Insomnia or Postman to interact with the available routes.
